# Hewlett-Enterprice-Employees

Objective: To design a RESTful web service that efficiently manages employee records, leveraging Java Spring Boot for backend development and HPE GreenLake for secure cloud storage.

### Step 1: Tools and Technologies

Java Spring Boot: Chosen for its simplicity and powerful features for building RESTful APIs. It allows for rapid development with minimal boilerplate code and supports easy integration with databases using Spring Data JPA.

HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform: Selected for hosting the application and storing data on a secure private cloud. GreenLake offers a scalable, managed infrastructure that ensures high availability and reliability for enterprise applications.

### Step 2: Service Design

The web service will support the following API endpoints:

GET /employees:

Purpose: Retrieve a list of all employees.
Implementation: This endpoint will call a service layer method to fetch all employee records from the database and return them in JSON format.

POST /employees:

Purpose: Add a new employee to the system.
Implementation: This endpoint will accept employee details (first name, last name, employee ID, email, and title) in the request body, validate the input, and save the new record in the database.

PUT /employees/{id}:

Purpose: Update an existing employee's information.
Implementation: This endpoint will locate an employee by their ID and update the specified fields with the new data provided in the request body.

DELETE /employees/{id}:

Purpose: Remove an employee from the system.
Implementation: This endpoint will delete the employee record associated with the given ID.

### Step 3: Deployment and Security

Deployment: The application will be packaged as a JAR file and deployed on HPE GreenLake. A MySQL or PostgreSQL database hosted on GreenLake will store employee data.

Security:

Authentication and authorization will be implemented using Spring Security.
All data transfers will be secured using HTTPS.
Sensitive information, such as employee emails, will be encrypted at rest.
